/**
 * INSTRUCTIONS.
 * 
 * Problem Set 3 will be more extensive than the first two. You've been warned. Practice makes perfect,
 * and we'll get a lot of practice with conditional and iterative control structures.
 * 
 * A few new concepts are being introduced with this assignment. Last time, we saw methods (other than
 * the @main method) for the first time. Now, we're seeing parameters, which are the variables inside
 * the parentheses in our methods. We'll cover these in more detail later. For now, you just need to
 * understand the basics.
 * 
 * A parameter is data that is provided to the method. It helps the method do its job. It's passed in
 * through the parentheses, and you can reference these variables by name as if they're your own.
